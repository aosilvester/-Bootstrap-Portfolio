                    Hello! This is my portfolio website. This website was built as the first homework assignment for the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at University of Richmond. I am looking to become a full stack specialist.

                <p>
                     In my free time, I am a musician. I know the Trombone, Tuba and Baritone. I am currently learning how to play the ukulele. In my time in college, I was a member of the university marching band. It afforded me the opportunity to travel across the country and see places I would never have the chance to otherwise. I made lifetime friends, and look back fondly on my time there.

                <p>
                     In an attempt to be healthy and nutritious, I have been learning to cook. If you ask my wife I cook eggs the best. I love outdoor cooking so much, I have two grills and a smoker. If I had more time, I would barbecue every day.
